Step 1: Clarify the Repurposing Goal

You want to repurpose the existing SustainaTrend™ platform to:
	•	Serve Private Equity & Venture Capital firms.
	•	Integrate automated sustainability benchmarking, sentiment analysis, and APA RAG Agent workflows.
	•	Avoid code duplication by identifying reusable components in the current Replit workspace.
	•	Run everything within the existing app flow using AI-powered modular workflows.

Step 2: Define the Upgrade Scope

To upgrade intelligently, we need a clear map of what’s already in the codebase vs. what needs to be enhanced or added. This means we need:
	1.	Architectural Inventory (What’s Already Built?)
	•	Which routes exist (e.g., /dashboard, /search, /uploads)?
	•	What microservices are available (web scraping, sentiment scoring, benchmarking)?
	•	Are Omniparser + document analysis workflows functional and modular?
	•	Does the Gemini integration support retrieval-based workflows (RAG), or is it just chat?
	•	Where are AI agents called from, and how is their context controlled?
	2.	Workflow Gaps for PE/VC Use Cases
	•	Are there flows for due diligence, founder profiling, deal screening?
	•	Can we plug in a sentiment model to monitor startups or news?
	•	Do we have a benchmarking engine by investment stage, geography, or sector?
	•	Do we support generating IC memos or investor briefings in Google Docs or Notion?
	3.	Data Structure Alignment
	•	Do we have database schemas for:
	•	Portfolio companies
	•	Funding stages
	•	Regulatory alignment scores
	•	Sentiment timelines
	•	Startup documents + metadata?
	•	If not, what needs to be added?
	4.	LLM Agent Pipeline (RAG-Based)
	•	Where is the vector store currently configured (Qdrant, Pinecone, etc.)?
	•	Do we chunk and embed startup documents, news, and filings already?
	•	Is there a unified query interface that can interact across different data types?
	5.	UI and Navigation Consistency
	•	Are current routes styled consistently? (Based on your prior ask for Finchat-style UI)
	•	Is Gemini the only search bar in use?
	•	Do we have a VC/PE-focused dashboard pane?
	•	How can we rewire the UI to dynamically reflect PE/VC-specific insights?
