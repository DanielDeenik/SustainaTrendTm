To transform the Strategy Hub into an AI-driven management consulting platform, we can employ chain-of-thought and atom-of-thought prompt engineering to restructure and refactor the existing code. Here's a structured approach:​

1. Simplify the User Interface (UI)

Objective: Create a clean, intuitive UI that focuses on user inputs and AI-generated outputs, minimizing manual details.​

Implementation:

Unified Input Section: Design a simple form where users can input key parameters such as industry, company size, and sustainability focus areas.​

AI-Powered Recommendations: Replace detailed manual sections with an interface that allows users to request AI-generated strategy recommendations.​

Interactive Trend Analyzer: Implement an input field where users can specify sustainability trends and receive instant visual feedback on their virality potential.​

2. Enhance AI Processing Capabilities

Objective: Utilize AI to analyze data, benchmark companies, and provide actionable insights using management consulting frameworks.​

Implementation:

Data Analysis and Benchmarking: Develop AI models to process user inputs, analyze relevant data, and benchmark companies against industry standards.​

Management Consulting Frameworks: Integrate frameworks such as SWOT analysis and Porter's Five Forces into the AI's decision-making process to substantiate recommendations.​

3. Generate Comprehensive AI-Driven Reports

Objective: Produce detailed documents that present data insights and strategic suggestions, minimizing the need for manual interpretation.​

Implementation:

Automated Report Generation: Enable the AI to compile analysis results into comprehensive, downloadable reports, including visualizations and actionable recommendations.​

Visual Data Representations: Incorporate charts, graphs, and other visual aids to effectively communicate insights within the reports.​

4. Refactor Existing Codebase

Objective: Restructure the current code to align with the new AI-driven approach, ensuring modularity and scalability.​

Implementation:

Modular Architecture: Break down the code into distinct modules for data processing, AI analysis, and UI components to enhance maintainability.​

Integration of AI Models: Embed AI functionalities within the backend to handle data analysis and report generation seamlessly.
