Step 4: Keep Utilities
Utility Route	Purpose
/debug	Route verification and debugging (internal use)
/static/<path:filename>	Serve static assets (CSS, JS, images)

🚀 Final Instruction to Replit AI for Execution:
"Using the provided chain-of-thought breakdown, refactor SustainaTrend's routing system:

Keep only listed core routes and APIs.
Remove all deprecated and duplicate routes.
Implement a unified left sidebar for navigation (no top nav).
Ensure navigation is smooth and tested.
Deliver final routes.py, sidebar template, and a summary of changes."
⚙️ Optional addition:

"Use Tailwind CSS for sidebar styling if CSS isn't defined yet."
