Trend & Virality Benchmarking Module for SustainaTrendâ„¢

This module provides advanced trend analysis and virality benchmarking for sustainability topics
using the STEPPS framework to assess why certain topics gain traction, with competitor benchmarking
and integration of management consulting frameworks for strategic insights.

Key features:
1. STEPPS framework analysis (Social currency, Triggers, Emotion, Public, Practical value, Stories)
2. Real-time sustainability trend monitoring
3. Competitor benchmarking for online sustainability presence
4. Strategic framework integration (Porter's Five Forces, McKinsey 7S)
5. Data-driven storytelling elements for strategic positioning
6. Science-Based Targets initiative (SBTi) alignment and recommendation generator
