Storytelling Service for SustainaTrendâ„¢

This service creates data-driven story cards with:
1. Headline (15 words max)
2. Narrative summary (3-5 sentences)
3. AI chart recommendation
4. Context (regulatory/framework connections)
5. Recommended actions

Each story follows Gartner's three-part structure:
- Context: Why this matters now
- Narrative: What is happening in the data
- Visual: AI-generated chart recommendation
