Science-Based Targets Module for SustainaTrend™

This module provides functionality for generating science-based target recommendations
aligned with the Science-Based Targets initiative (SBTi) methodology.

Key features:
1. Industry-specific science-based target recommendations
2. Implementation guidance for target-setting
3. Business case development for science-based targets
4. Reference company analysis for benchmarking
5. Visual reporting and target tracking interfaces
